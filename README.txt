Data lookup exercise (linux)
A) Can you please tell us, how many times the id be4e071c11594bb0b4ee3c444fd08b99
for Product “B” occurs in the input file and in your output file? What is your observation? How
can you explain?

Product “B” occurs
in the input file: 4 times
in my output file: 3 times

The number of occurences of be4e071c11594bb0b4ee3c444fd08b99 was reducesed because I dropped the duplicate rows before creating productB.csv.

B) Can you show us the distinct number of occurrences of the events we receive in the
output of Product “A” with a solution? What is your observation on the output of this solution?
How can you explain?

2 click
3 open
1 unsub

Number of clicks, and unsub remains the same. The number of open events reduced from 4 to 3 because there was a duplicate open event in the input file and I removed the duplicates before saving the output file.
